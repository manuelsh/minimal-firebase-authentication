# Minimal Firebase sign in page using FirebaseUI

This is a minimal html and JavaScript code to activate the authorisation functions for signing using Firebase and FirebaseUI.

The motivation of this repo is that the example in the original [Firebase UI repo](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web) does not work by itself.

## How to use

1. Create a Firebase project and enable the authentication method you want to use.
2. Edit the login.html file by replacing the configuration parameters with your own.
3. Use as you wish.

## Contributing

As I imagine new versions of FirebaseUI will be released, contributions are welcome to keep this repo up to date.
